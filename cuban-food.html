          <dd>Ropa vieja is possibly one of the most recognized Cuban recipes throughout the world. This dish is, apparently, an inheritance of the
            peninsular culture of the Spanish Canary Islands. The dish consists of previously boiled and shredded meat, cooked in a sauce with onion, bell peppers,
            bay leaves, and cumin, among other ingredients.
              Beef is the meat used in this recipe, but it can also be done with pork or, in some rare cases, chicken. The key to this recipe is to highlight the flavor of the meat.
              Therefore, always be careful when boiling it. A secret: stew the meat in a good bean broth; this will give you a very special result.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>Rice and black beans are an essential complement to Cuban dishes. Without them, it is impossible to have a good Cuban lunch or dinner. The rice and black beans always
            accompany the main dish such as Ropa vieja or Lechón asado.
              The recipe is simple, but it takes time, especially the beans. No canning involved here. The special processing of these two products is the key to this dish. The key to the rice is
              to cook it till it falls apart. The beans should have a creamy, smooth texture like a stew.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>The ground beef a la habanera is an exquisite ground meat cooked over low heat with seasonings, tomato sauce, potatoes, and olives. This dish derives from Cuba´s Spanish heritage. Any type
            of meat can be used for its preparation, but the most common are beef, pork, chicken, and turkey.
              This dish is an everyday meal for Cubans. It is regularly served with rice, fried ripe plantains, and, occasionally, beans.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>The pork steak is seen as the Cuban version of a beef steak. Originally this term referred only to beef, but in Cuba it is applied to other meats such as pork or chicken.
                Pork steak and onions, in particular, stands out as a Cuban favorite. The steak is generally thin and juicy. In addition, a little salt, garlic, onion and oregano are added.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>The chicken fricassee is another of the delicious dishes in which meat is accompanied with a tasty tomato sauce with seasonings. The chicken is cut into portions and marinated for a few hours with salt, crushed garlic,
            onion wheels, chili pepper, bay leaf, and sour orange juice.
                Then the chicken pieces are browned in the hot butter or oil, the marinade with the onions, chili peppers, the well-crushed garlic, the bay leaf and the orange are added. To finish, add the
                tomato puree, dry wine, water, salt and pepper.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>This Cuban food is based on pork or beef. Spices, a rich tomato sauce, and potatoes cut into squares are added. In some places wine is added and in others beer.
             It is served with rice, fried or ripe plantains, and vegetables.
                The truth is that there is no specific season to taste this Cuban dish, so you can try it in any traditional restaurant.</dd></fieldset><br>

            <dd>The Cuban sandwich is one of the most popular contributions of the Cuban American community to Cuban cuisine. This semi-hard bread is the base of
              two popular sandwiches: pan con lechón (roast pork), and the ham and cheese sandwich.
                The Cuban sandwich is made up of ham, cheese, and roast pork. Afterwards, you just add some mustard, pickles, and sometimes mojo salsa.</dd><br>

          <dd>If you have ever visited Cuba, you will probably know what this next offering is. The tasty pan con lechón is a typical sandwich that you can buy in any Cuban cafeteria, as well as
            at small timbiriches (food stands) in the middle of the street.
              Bread with roast pork is possibly the most popular sandwich on the island. The soft dough of the bread goes perfectly with the shredded pork, and its special mojo. You can
            also add tomato, lettuce, and pickles.</dd><br>

          <dd>The original Frita is a Cuban dish with a seasoned ground beef and pork patty (sometimes mixed with chorizo) on Cuban bread
            topped with shoestring potatoes. Variations also include lettuce, onions, and a spiced ketchup sauce. A similar dish on Cuban bread is
            called pan con bistec (bistec de palomilla) topped with the shoestring potatoes. This type of burger is found mainly in South Florida.</dd><br>

          <dd>A medianoche consists of roast pork, ham, mustard, Swiss cheese, and sweet pickles. It is a close cousin to the Cuban sandwich, the chief difference being that a
             medianoche is made on soft, sweet egg dough bread similar to Challah rather than on crustier Cuban bread. Like the Cuban sandwich, the medianoche is typically warmed in a press before
             eating.</dd><br>

          <dd>Yucca with mojo is another dish always found at Cuban family celebrations. It is a simple and healthy dish usually offered as an appetizer. And that’s because
            given the high concentration of glucose in this tuber, it is not a good idea to eat it in large It is not recommended to eat in large quantities due to the high concentration of
            glucose caused by this tuber.
              There are two different types of cooking for cassava with mojo: boiled and fried. However, in both cases it is necessary to boil the cassava to obtain a soft texture.
               After achieving the required texture, it only remains to add the mojo sauce, and sometimes pork rinds. </dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>The tamale is a typical food of many places in Latin America, precisely because it is based on corn, which is a major agricultural product in this part of the world. However, each region or
            country has its own way of developing this recipe.
              In Cuba you can find several variants of the tamales recipe that affect both the flavor and the texture of the corn. The flavor of the Cuban tamale ranges from sweet to seasoned meat and sauce. The texture depends on
            the cooking process: in sheets (solid) or in a casserole (thick or pasty soup). It is important to note that the leaf used to make the Cuban tamale is corn.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>The ripe banana is the most faithful companion to Cuban meals. It is a direct legacy of the African cultures that arrived on the island. The sweetness that it offers to each dish
             is very special to Cubans. The recipe is very simple. The banana is cut into slices and fried in hot oil. Sometimes a little salt and seasonings are sprinkled on top.
              The best combinations of meals including fried ripe plantain are: rice, black beans, and some types of cooked meat; rice and fried egg; and rice and picadillo
            a la habanera.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>Tostón or chatino is one of the most traditional Cuban starters. It is made with green or ripe banana. To prepare it, the banana is cut into round slices, fried, and then mashed with a mallet. Then
            they are fried again until golden brown.
                This is the simplest and most basic recipe. Sometimes these tostones and accompanied by a sauce or dressing. Tostones can also be made with different fillings. You just shape it into
            a pot and fill it before frying.</dd></fieldset><br>

          <dd>Banana chips (also called banana crisps in British English) are deep-fried or dried, generally crispy slices of bananas. They are usually made from firmer, starchier banana varieties
            ("cooking bananas" or plantains) like the Saba and Nendran cultivars. They can be sweet or savory, and can be covered with sugar, honey, salt, or various spices.</dd></fieldset><br>
